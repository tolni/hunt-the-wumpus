 [0] Well, this is it! This is your big chance to make a lot of~ money in a very short space of time (the faster you do this~ the more you will earn) OR die in an equally short period.~ The choice is yours ...~~ The long climb through the mountains has left you a little~ bit shaky, but that could also be just an increase in your~ adreneline. The sounds of the cheering crowds have long~ since faded into the distance.~~ Your quiver of arrows is securely slung over your back, some~ food in your pouch and a full lantern, which is now burning~ burning brightly in your hand. OK, the lantern isn't going to~ last all day so you'd better have at it, hmmm?~~ Enter the cave to see what you have let yourself in for ...
